# Question 2a: Use two tabs to separate the evaluated variables in the string

# Question 6: Use slicing notation to print the last 6 letters of the string
# below. Assume you donot know the start index or the length of the string upfront.
# Hint: You will need to use a function to find the length first and then use that,
# in combination with the number to come up with the start index
